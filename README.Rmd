# DeepGP: Deep Gaussian Process Models for Function Approximation

## Project Overview

This repository contains research on Deep Gaussian Process (DeepGP) models for advanced function approximation. The project focuses on comparing standard Gaussian Process (GP) models with Deep Gaussian Process variants (DGP2 and DGP3) across multiple complex test functions.

## Research Objectives

- Evaluate the performance of standard Gaussian Processes
- Compare standard GP with two-layer (DGP2) and three-layer (DGP3) Deep Gaussian Process models
- Analyze model behavior across different function complexities and dimensionalities

## Test Functions

The project evaluates model performance using five benchmark test functions:

1. **Ackley Function**: 
   - Multimodal function with many local minima
   - Typically evaluated in 2-10 dimensions
   - Input range: [-32.768, 32.768]
   - Global minimum at the origin

2. **Hartmann-6 Function**:
   - 6-dimensional function with multiple local minima
   - Input range: [0, 1]
   - Global minimum: approximately -3.32

3. **Branin Function**:
   - 2-dimensional function with three global minima
   - Input ranges: x1 ∈ [-5, 10], x2 ∈ [0, 15]
   - Serves as a baseline case for standard GP performance

4. **Michalewicz Function**:
   - Features steep ridges and valleys
   - d! local minima
   - Typically evaluated in 2-10 dimensions
   - Input range: [0, π]
   - Steepness controlled by parameter m (default=10)

5. **Rosenbrock Function**:
   - Also known as the Banana function
   - Narrow curved valley with strong parameter dependencies
   - Typically evaluated in 2-20 dimensions
   - Input range: [-5, 10]
